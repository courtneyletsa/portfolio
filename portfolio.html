                    <p>Fellow Ghanaians, good evening ……. As of Wednesday, 6th May, a total of 135,902 tests had been conducted……

                    <h2>Climate change and impact in Africa</h2>
                    <p>The United Nations define climate change as long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun’s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas.
