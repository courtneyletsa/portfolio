    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <p>I started out as a Geoscientist but made the
        transition to tech about a year ago. To
        expand my skill set, I am studying data
        analytics with Python on DataCamp. This is
        because my knowledge on Earth’s systems
        and analytical skills can be a valuable asset
        in the tech industry. Currently I work as a
        Training Assistant at Soronko Academy
        helping to train over 100 young ladies with
        digital skills under the Rotary Girls’ Coding
        and the MasterCard Women in Digital Skills
        projects. Additionally, on the weekends, I
        mentor a group of young women from
        Nigeria and Kenya studying data analytics
        with Eloquent Data, a Pan-African data
        community, by supporting them in their data
        learning journey.</p>
